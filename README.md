# ScienceAgent with Google Gemini API & openai-agents

This project demonstrates how to create a simple science chatbot using the **[openai-agents](https://pypi.org/project/openai-agents/)** library with **Google Gemini API** in a Google Colab environment.  
The chatbot answers science-related questions in a short, fun way â€” sprinkling in occasional jokes for comic relief.
